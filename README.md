# Azure CLI Context Switcher

## What is the Azure CLI Context Switcher?

It's an CLI tool to switch between Azure CLI login's in a similar was as `kubectl config set-context`.

It replaced the need to remember, or keep track of your tenant id's, service principal names and secrets to perform a `az clear` and `az login` when you want to switch tenants.
